The accept() function shall extract the first connection on the queue of pending connections, create a new socket with the same socket type protocol and address family as the specified socket, and allocate a new file descriptor for that socket.

The accept() function takes the following arguments:

socket
Specifies a socket that was created with socket(), has been bound to an address with bind(), and has issued a successful call to listen().
address
Either a null pointer, or a pointer to a sockaddr structure where the address of the connecting socket shall be returned.
address_len
Points to a socklen_t structure which on input specifies the length of the supplied sockaddr structure, and on output specifies the length of the stored address.
If address is not a null pointer, the address of the peer for the accepted connection shall be stored in the sockaddr structure pointed to by address, and the length of this address shall be stored in the object pointed to by address_len.af
